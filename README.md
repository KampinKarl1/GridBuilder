# GridBuilder
In the Unity game engine (let's say Version 4.6 and above), create a grid with an object of your choice.

Attach the script to an object in the scene.

Create the object you'd like the grid to be made of.

Optionally add a parent to the objectParent field so that the objects don't take over your hierarchy.

Click "buildGrid" in the inspector.
